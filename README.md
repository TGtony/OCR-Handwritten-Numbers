# OCR-Handwritten-Numbers
Computational Vision Project, Fall 2016

Program to detect and read handwritten numbers from an image.
Implemented using OpenCV 3.0 and C++
k-nearest neighbor machine learning used to create model.


PROGRAM 1
	./p1 <label file .txt> <train data .txt> <counter>

	Inputs arguments:
		1) text file to store labels
		2) text file to store training data
		3) counter (10 or 15)

	Outputs files:
		1) text file with labels
		2) text file with training data

	Images associated with program 1:
		0.jpg to 14.jpg



PROGRAM 2
	./p2 <test image> <label file .txt> <train data .txt>


	Input arguments:
		1) test image
		2) text file with labels generated from program 1
		3) text file with training data generated from program 2

	Outputs files:

	Images associated with program 2:
		test1.jpg to test4.jpg


PROGRAM 3
	./p3 <test image> <label file .txt> <train data .txt>

	Input arguments:
		1) test image
		2) text file with labels generated from program 1
		3) text file with training data generated from program 2


	Outputs files:

	Images associated with program 3:
